## Description
This Pokedex app was created following the *Build an app with React & GraphQL* Scrimba course (https://scrimba.com/learn/reactgraphql).

### What I learned
This was an amazing opportunity for me to learn how to use **GraphQL** and **Apollo**

#### Technologies used
React, GraphQL,  Apollo, CSS, Pokemon open API (https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/)

#### What I did
- made a **GraphQL query** to a pokemon API to create a *Pokemon Pokedex* that displays information about the pokemon, like
    - name
    - maxHP
    - maxCP
    - special attack names
